# Bike Sales Dashboard



## Data Analysis and Visualization using Excel
In this project I have used a dataset related to bike sales

## Description
This dashboard can be used to visualise the:

1)Average income of customers by gender per purchased bike.

2)Age brackets and education levels of customers according to whether they purchased a bike or not.

3)Commuting distances of customers according to whether they purchased a bike or not.

The dashboard can be filtered by:

1)Marital status

2)Region

3)Occupation

4)education
## Tasks 
1)Data cleaning (e.g. removing duplicate observations and recoding the marital status and gender variables).

2)Nested IF with multiple AND formula for creating the age brackets.

3)Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.

4)Selecting appropriate chart types for visualising the data.

5)Using slicers to filter the pivot tables by region, occupation, education and marital status
